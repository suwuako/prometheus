Prometheus documentation
########################

Prometheus is a simple, silly linker written from scratch! This isn't that serious of a
project, instead aiming to be more of an educational experience on how linkers work in
general!

Documentation will be split in two parts: The theory behind the linking process and
how it's applied and the actual documentation for the code itself. Hopefully you'll find
the knowledge here useful as well!! :D
